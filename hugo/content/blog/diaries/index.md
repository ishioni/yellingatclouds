At some point in your history, you might have had an argument with your significant other. It might have been out of laziness, malaise or a simple misunderstanding. This is a story of the 3rd kind.

My girlfriend of past would regularly record her story into a diary regularly, especially when things in life got rough. Every time she did, she would inform me of the fact with glee, as if to tempt me to figure out what could be in it. After some time of this, I got bored and and read the book back to back. A little while later I mentioned the fact, commenting on one thing or other. Once she pieced together what happened, another row ensued, accusing me of breaching privacy and whatnot. I was confused by this. What was the point of all this if not for that exact outcome? It took a long while to convince her that there was no ill intent on my part. It took a longer while still to make me understand why people write diaries in the first place. And quite a revelation it was. 

"People write diaries to organize their thoughts" is what it came down to, and after some introspection I understood the allure. This is not unlike what Freud discovered with psychotherapy, or what (most probably) was the original intent with catholic confessions. Internal dialogue is amorphous and fleeting, putting it outside of our heads forces it to take a discrete shape and forms new memories. It's a chance to reflect on what part is important and deserves to be remembered, and what can be discarded as irrelevant to the topic.

But then, if I contrast it with a very private book, one not really meant to be read, but to be a kind of WORM medium, why put it up on the Internet? Well dear reader, if you got here, it was most probably by following a trail of breadcrumbs. There are no analytics on this page, no linkbacks, not even a comment section - since diaries don't really allow for such things. This is not a forum, not a stage for me to be famous. This is my personal recluse from the modern world, filled by things that feed on your attention, and more often than not, things that aren't even human anymore.

The point of this site is so that I can yell at clouds, coherently, and that maybe someone sometime will discover these, and feel a connection to a human being instead of doomscrolling another AI ad on the Internet. No EM dashes, no emojis, no paragraphs on why it's important. Just like it was for me 20 something years ago.

Enjoy
